# EV Trainer (Runtime Preview)

## Manual preview
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the Next.js dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open the local URL printed by Next.js.

### Determinism note
Runtime determinism (explicit seed and session IDs) will be wired in Tasks B–D.
Until then, the preview is a static placeholder.
