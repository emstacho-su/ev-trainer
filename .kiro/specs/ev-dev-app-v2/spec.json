  "project_description": "Build v2 dev app UX that cleanly separates Training (per-decision grading + end-of-session summary) from Practice (no metrics during run; review unlocked at end), with EV-first metrics, a minimum viable filter set (street, hero/villain position, effective stack bucket, pot type), localStorage persistence for session records, a Spot-first runtime API boundary, and an Evaluator-preserving path toward server-side solver integration."
